The Binary tree means that the node can have maximum two children. Thus, degree of each node of a binary tree can be 0,1 or 2.

PROPERTIES OF BINARY TREE:-

At each level of i, the maximum number of nodes is 2^i.
If every non leaf node in a binary tree has nonempty left and right subtrees, the tree is termed as strictly binary tree. The Strictly Binary
Tree with n leaves always contains 2n-1 nodes.
The height of the tree is defined as the longest path from the root node to the leaf node.In general, the maximum number of nodes possible at
height h is (2^0+ 2^1 + 2^2+….2^h) = 2h+1 - 1.                                            [Sum of Geometric Progression]
The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height H is 2H – 1.

Types of Binary Tree: There are four types of Binary tree:-

1. Full/ proper/ strict Binary tree

The full binary tree is also known as a strict binary tree. The tree can only be considered as the full binary tree if each node must contain
either 0 or 2 children. The full binary tree can also be defined as the tree in which each node must contain 2 children except the leaf nodes.
Properties of Full Binary Tree:-

The number of leaf nodes is equal to the number of internal nodes plus 1 OR If you have n leaf nodes, then number of internal nodes is n-1.
The maximum number of nodes is the same as the number of nodes in the binary tree, i.e., 2^(h+1) -1.
The minimum number of nodes in the full binary tree is 2*h-1.
The minimum height of the full binary tree is log2(n+1) - 1.
The maximum height of the full binary tree can be computed as:
n= 2*h - 1
n+1 = 2*h
h = n+1/2

2. Complete Binary Tree

The complete binary tree is a tree in which all the nodes are completely filled except the last level. In the last level, all the nodes must
be as left as possible. In a complete binary tree, the nodes should be added from the left.
Properties of complete binary tree :-

The maximum number of nodes in complete binary tree is 2^(h+1) - 1.
The minimum number of nodes in complete binary tree is 2^h.
The minimum height of a complete binary tree is log2(n+1) - 1.
If the parent is it index i so the left child is at 2i+1 and the right child is at 2i+2.

3. Perfect Binary Tree

A tree is a perfect binary tree if all the internal nodes have 2 children, and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.All the perfect binary
trees are the complete binary trees as well as the full binary tree, but vice versa is not true, i.e., all complete binary trees and full binary
trees are the perfect binary trees.
Properties of perfect binary tree :-

The maximum number of nodes in complete binary tree is 2^(h+1) - 1.
The minimum number of nodes in complete binary tree is 2^h where h is the height of the tree.
Maximum number of leaf nodes=2^h.
Minimum number of levels of a tree with height h = h+1.
The minimum number of levels for a perfect binary tree with n leaves is log2(n)+1.
The minimum number of levels for a perfect binary tree with n nodes is log2(n+1).

4. Degenerate/Skewed Binary Tree
The degenerate binary tree is a tree in which all the internal nodes have only one child.

NOTES:-
1. Perfect Binary Tree vs Complete Binary Tree:
A binary tree of height ‘h’ having the maximum number of nodes is a perfect binary tree.
For a given height h, the maximum number of nodes is 2h+1-1.
A complete binary tree of height h is a perfect binary tree up to height h-1, and in the last level element are stored in left to right order.
2. Another famous type of binary tree is Ordered Binary Tree, where each and every node has some property. For example: Binary Search Trees.
